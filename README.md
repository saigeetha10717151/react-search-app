This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

# Implementation Details

### Summary
As requested, I have completed the requirement and added my `OWN JSON data`, which highlights tourist attractions in various Indian states.

### JSON Information

 The JSON data was created using only selected countries, and I have implemented the filter based on that.

 We can see the JSON results [http://localhost:3000/db/data.json](http://localhost:3000/db/data.json) once up the local [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by using `npm start`
